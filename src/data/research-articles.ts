    content: ['Topological quantum computing has long been considered the holy grail of quantum information science. Unlike conventional qubits that are fragile and error-prone, topological qubits encode information in the global properties of a quantum system, making them inherently resistant to local noise and perturbation.', 'The key innovation lies in using Majorana fermions — exotic particles that are their own antiparticles. When these particles are braided around each other, they perform quantum computations that are inherently protected from local noise. This braiding operation is topologically protected, meaning small perturbations cannot corrupt the computation.', 'Microsoft\'s latest breakthrough achieved 99.9% gate fidelity, surpassing the threshold needed for practical quantum error correction. This means that topological quantum computers could require orders of magnitude fewer physical qubits than surface-code approaches.', 'The implications are staggering: drug discovery simulations that would take classical computers millions of years could be completed in hours.
